-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT subject, 
    First_value(score) OVER(Partition BY subject ORDER BY quiz_date DESC)
    As last_score
,First_value(score) OVER(Partition BY subject ORDER BY quiz_date) As First_score 
    FROM daily_quiz_scores;
