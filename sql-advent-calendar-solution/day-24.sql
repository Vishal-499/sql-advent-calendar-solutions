-- Table Schema:
-- Table: user_goals
--   user_id: INT
--   user_type: VARCHAR
--   goal_id: INT
--   goal_status: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

WITH user_completed AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    user_type,
    COUNT(*) AS completed_count
  FROM user_goals
  WHERE goal_status = 'completed'
  GROUP BY user_id, user_type
)
SELECT
  user_type,
  AVG(completed_count) AS avg_completed_goals_per_user
FROM user_completed
GROUP BY user_type
ORDER BY user_type;
